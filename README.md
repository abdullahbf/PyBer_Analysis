# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose and Objectives 

In this repository, ride sharing data was analyzed using pandas and Matplotlib to determine the differences according to city type. The analysis was then used to make suggestions about improving the business.

## Analysis and Results

Figure 1 was a scatterplot snapshot of the dataset. The image shows us the relationship between the average fares and the total number of rides (per city) for each type, rural, suburban, and urban. Circle sizes correlate with the driver count for each city. Easy to see that the difference in driver count between urban and rural cities. The plot also shows us that the average fares are higher for most rural cities when compared to urban ones.

Figure 2 lets us see how the number of rides differ per city type. The results are what one would expect.

Figure 3 highlights the fare ($USD) differences between the three city types. Rural city type has the largest interquaartile range of the three, as well as having the highest median value.

Figure 4 shows us the disparity in the number of drivers available per city type.

This figure (5) is a representation of % total fares and it's clear that majority of the total fares are urban cities. 

![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92544151/152472351-75eda4c0-c8ef-48f3-a497-ff1af883fd73.png)

Figure 6 shows that vast majority of the % total rides come from urban cities too (68.4%). Rural cities have a measly 5.3% of total rides.
